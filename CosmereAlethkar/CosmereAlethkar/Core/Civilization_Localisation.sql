	'Alethkar is the largest and most prominent of the five Vorin nations on Roshar. People from Alethkar are known as Alethi, and their royal colors are blue and gold. Alethkar lies in eastern Roshar, stretching across the entire continent, from the Steamwater Ocean in the North to the Tarat Sea in the South-West. To the East, it leans on the Unclaimed Hills, while to the South, it reaches the nationless Frostlands and the Shattered Plains, the latter of which it has recently claimed for itself. In the West, Alethkar has a long and long-disputed border with Jah Keved, which currently follows two rivers and the bend of the Sunmaker Mountains. In North-West, Alethkar borders Herdaz across a stretch of land decided through a few years of border wars. Due to how far east it is, Alethkar is buffeted by particularly heavy highstorms. This forces settlements to primarily be built on the leeward sides of laits. These leeward sides are also far more lush with plant life, due to the protection the liats provide from powerful highstorm winds.'),	
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2',		
	'The Alethi people are generally tan -- darker-skinned than the Veden and Shin, but not as dark as the Makabaki -- with dark, typically black hair. They are typically extremely tall, standing on average at least a foot taller than people living further West. Like most Rosharan people, they possess Epicanthic folds and see those without folds as wide-eyed and childish. They are a very racially-mixed people due to their history of conquest. Alethi discourage emotional openness and any show of what could be perceived as a weakness; an engaged couple keeping close in public is considered, while not obscene, at least extremely improper. Men are encouraged to be combative and forceful, and women to be witty and willing to engage in barbed banter. Unwillingness or inability to act in this way can often lead to a person being labeled as inept or stupid.'),	
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3',	
	'Like all Vorin nations, Alethi practice a division between the sexes. Women have safehands, covered either by a buttoned-up sleeve, typical of lighteyes, or a glove, typical of darkeyes. They are discouraged from picking up weapons and fighting. By contrast, men are forbidden to read. As such, oftentimes a man and a woman will work together as a team in an important position that overlaps both their areas of responsibility, such as the military, with the woman acting as a scribe while the man issues commands. The militaristic nature of the Alethi further influences this divide, leading to most of Alethi rulers being kings, and women rarely, if ever, becoming highprincesses.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4',	
	'The Alethi culture is divided into two major castes, the lighteyes and darkeyes, separated by, as can be surmised, the color of a person''s eyes. The lighteyes form the upper caste, with broader rights and privileges, while the darkeyes are the lower, working caste. Furthermore, each caste is divided into ten ranks, with the lighteyed ranks being called dahns, while the darkeyed ones are the nahns. Some nahns and dahns are hereditary, or stable, while others can only be held by attaining a particular position.[90] The Alethi monarch, for example, is the only person in the country holding the first dahn. There are many ways for a person to improve their rankings, such as through marriage or military service. A soldier who becomes an officer will almost automatically be raised to a proper dahn or nahn, along with their children. Holding land automatically entitles a lighteyes to at least the sixth dahn, regardless of their previous status, and becoming a Shardbearer entitles at least the fourth dahn.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5',	
	'The Alethi culture is highly militaristic, stemming from their origins as Alethela. A soldier is considered the highest religious Calling, with the fight to reclaim the Tranquiline Halls being believed to be the greatest afterlife one could hope for. The country is almost perpetually at war, if not between the highprinces, then with some external power. Children as young as twelve can and sometimes are recruited by raving armies to feed this endless war machine. Military service is one of the more reliable paths of social advancement in Alethkar. A soldier can expect to raise in dahn or nahn to match his military rank. Moreover, many darkeyed soldiers go to war hoping to defeat a Shardbearer and gain ownership of a Shardblade, due to a widespread belief -- later proven correct -- that bonding a Blade would change their eyes to light-colored. Alongside this culture, the Alethi highly honor the Thrill, a form of battle-lust that can sometimes encompass them when in combat. The Thrill is often considered a private thing, not to be shared with others; however, it''s also highly desirable, with men often awaiting its arrival when in combat. For many, it''s downright addictive.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6',	
	'Alethkar was founded as Alethela in the Silver Kingdoms Epoch, settled by Ashynite emigrants who arrived on Roshar in Shinovar, before eventually expanding outward and settling all across Roshar. They were an extremely militaristic nation which remembered and studied the arts of war so that they would be able to teach it to new generations whenever a Desolation comes. Due to this, the Knight''s Radiant primarily lived in Alethela, even if their operations were based in Urithiru. This militarism laid the foundation for modern Alethi militarism and military strength.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7',	
	'At some point early in its history, it was ruled over by King Nohadon. During one Desolation during his life, they fought for over eleven years and nine-in-ten Alethelan citizens were killed. Eiliz, Tarma, and Sur, likely sub-divisions of Alethela, fell during this Desolation. They are no longer remembered in modern historical memory by 1173. Nohadon wanted to abdicate due to the tragic events of this Desolation, however, he kept his throne and tried to rebuild. Over the decades, he successfully managed to rebuild Alethela into a bustling and colorful place. Eventually, he went to war with Makabakam over trade routes, the full effects this had on both kingdoms are unknown.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_8',	
	'Alethela survived the Desolations, but fell under the sway of the Hierocracy some point after the Recreance. This was occurred as religion permeated every aspect of life and Ardents were allowed to own poperty and political office, and were seen as the only figures capable of interpreting scripture. This allowed them to, at some point, overthrow the power of the government and make themselves into a powerful theocracy, claiming the divine right to rule over mankind. They further controlled the populace through their access to information, both religious and secular.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_9',	
	'This lasted until the Sunmaker led the kingdom in a successful revolt against Vorin rule circa 673, known as the War of Loss. Following his successful reunification of Alethela under the name of Alethkar, he set his eyes upon the rest of Roshar. Many cities were sacked and destroyed in this war and the chaos of its aftermath, with Kholinar being one of the few eastern cities to survive.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_10',	
	'After the Sunmaker''s death, his ten sons could not agree on one of their number as his successor. With none of them willing to forego their claim to the throne, they split the kingdom into ten princedoms, which they ruled individually as Highprinces, with no unifying government. The legacy of this era would live on, with the Alethi seeing him as a great conquerer and a hero to his people, while many other people across the world saw him as a genocidal tyrant.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_11',	
	'Several centuries later, in approximately 1140, Gavilar Kholin--inspired by the Sunmaker--sought to conquer and unite the highprinces, which he achieved by about 1145. He was then crowned king and his brother Dalinar Kholin became highprince to the Kholin Princedom. However, due to the lineage of each Princedom going back to the Sunmaker and his sons, the Highprinces were loathe to surrender their autonomous power to a supreme ruler. The integrity and unity of Gavilar''s kingdom is therefore questionable, as evidenced by the ferocity with which the Highprinces resisted his military approach to unification and continued to strain against his rule.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_ALETHKAR_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_12',	
	'When Gavilar was assassinated by Szeth under the orders of the Parshendi in 1167, his son, Elhokar Kholin, became king and declared war on the killers. Each of the highprinces joined the Vengeance Pact and they set out into the Shattered Plains to besiege the Parshendi in the War of Reckoning. During the war, the highprince Dalinar Kholin began to have visions of the past, and warnings of the future.'),

	'Shardblades were often one of the most tangible expressions of power between various nations. Kingdoms with many Shardblades were often considered to be more politically powerful than the others. Those without Shardblades, especially the smaller kingdoms, lived in fear of those with Shardblades. In the major Vorin kingdoms, Alethkar and Jah Keved, Shardblades are sign of nobility and power. The highprinces of these nations and oftentimes their children or favored highlords typically have a Blade or two.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_BCA_SHARDBEARER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2',  	
	'While Shardblades were certainly renowned for their use in combat, that is not to say that they did not have any impact on culture. Rather, they were one of the most important drivers of Rosharan culture, most noticeably in the Vorin nations. They have influenced theology, mythology, society, and even introduced the sport of dueling into Alethkar and Jah Keved, two of the most powerful kingdoms on the face of Roshar.'	),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_BCA_SHARDBEARER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3',  	
	'According to Vorin doctrine, the Shardblades were gifts from the Almighty, used to fight the Voidbringers, who were said to have skin of stone. As humanity was barely making spears, and their metalworking was incredibly basic, they needed the aid of their god to drive the Voidbringers from Roshar and the Tranquiline Halls and back into Damnation.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_BCA_SHARDBEARER_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4',  	
	'Stories of heroes wielding Shardblades were pervasive among the peoples of Roshar, particularly the Vorin darkeyed. Young children play at having Shardblades, and dream of growing up to join the army and win one for themselves. Young lighteyed children often have wooden toy swords, carved to look like Shardblades. Some young men carry fine daggers carved in the likeness of Shardblades. In rural towns, the tales of Lanacin the Surefooted, Evod Markmaker, and Raninor of the Fields, legendary and revered darkeyes who won Shardblades, inspired men to go off to war in hopes of winning a Shardblade, and thus riches and fame for themselves and their loved ones. However, a darkeyes winning a Shardblade is so incredibly uncommon that it has not happened in over a lifetime. Given the preponderance of Blades in the Vorin kingdoms, some see it as a sign that the nations themselves have been blessed by the Heralds.'),

	'The Alethi occupied the crater-like areas of the Shattered Plains and constructed ten warcamps, a royal palace, and a market. The palace complex includes the royal residence, Gallery of Maps, feasting basin, and a dueling arena. The warcamps are each a mixture of Soulcast buildings, shanties, and tents that are taken down before each highstorm. Each camp is self sufficient, with their own markets, taverns, brothels, and spanreed information stations to Tashikk. Most of the buildings are Soulcast using topaz. The bunkers and barracks are typically long and narrow with a smaller end facing the highstorms to the east.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_IMPROVEMENTS_PAGE_IMPROVEMENT_BCA_WARCAMP_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2', 
	'The barracks of the Kholin warcamp are organized into radials, with meeting areas, mess halls, and fireplaces at the center of each battalion. These battalions then circle Dalinar''s stone bunker complex and the living quarters of other ranking lighteyes and generals. The Kholin warcamp has more bunker-like construction than other warcamps, as Dalinar wanted his soldiers to remember that they were at war.');
