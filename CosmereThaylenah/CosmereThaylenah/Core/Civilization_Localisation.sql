	'Thaylenah is an island kingdom in the South of Roshar, with capital in Thaylen City. The people and language of Thaylenah are called the Thaylen. It encompasses a trio of islands, as well as a small number of islets, in the South-East of Roshar, on the ocean known as the Southern Depths. During the Heraldic Epochs, the islands that now compose Thaylenah were part of the Kingdom of Thalath. The current capital, Thaylen City, was likely also the capital of Thalath, as it possesses that state''s Oathgate. It''s unclear when the country broke apart; however, Thaylenah itself is about four thousand years old, according to the local tradition.'),	
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_THAYLENAH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2',		
	'In the Era of Solitude, Thaylenah became a titan of commerce, with their ships and caravans trading goods around the world. The country was largely peaceful, with no conflict or war within the past generation. Thaylenah is an elective monarchy. Following the death of a king or queen, an assembly of merchant councils and high-ranking naval officers elects the new ruler, with the current one being queen Fen Rnamdi. The ruler is said to represent the guilds of Thaylenah. While the kingdom follows the Vorin division between lighteyes and darkeyes, there doesn''t appear to exist a formalized noble caste analogous to Alethi or Veden highprinces and highlords. Rather than nahns and dahns, the Thaylen utilize their own system of ranks.'),	
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_THAYLENAH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_3',	
	'Like all Vorin nations, Alethi practice a division between the sexes. Women have safehands, covered either by a buttoned-up sleeve, typical of lighteyes, or a glove, typical of darkeyes. They are discouraged from picking up weapons and fighting. By contrast, men are forbidden to read. As such, oftentimes a man and a woman will work together as a team in an important position that overlaps both their areas of responsibility, such as the military, with the woman acting as a scribe while the man issues commands. The militaristic nature of the Alethi further influences this divide, leading to most of Alethi rulers being kings, and women rarely, if ever, becoming highprincesses.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_THAYLENAH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_4',	
	'Thaylenah appears to have little in the way of a land army, but they do have a long-standing naval tradition famous the world over. Thaylen officers are trained in naval tactics and strategy to a far greater extent than their counterparts elsewhere, and their country boasts a large fleet. One of Roshar''s ten Oathgates is located in Thaylen City, adding to its importance.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_THAYLENAH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_5',	
	'The Thaylen have a system of underwriting trades based around the Thaylen Gemstone Reserve in the capital. Each sphere stored there has an owner and an identifying number. People trade the gemstones among themselves using the number; however, rather than taking the spheres in and out of the vaults, they leave them inside. The system functions properly so long as people trust the Reserve that the money is there, allowing merchants to trade large sums without the usual dangers associated with it. This, along with the existence of spanreeds to trade over, allows Thaylen banks to have wide networks all over the continent, with branches in major cities like Kholinar.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_THAYLENAH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_6',	
	'The Thaylen people are tanned, thought not as dark as the Reshi, and, like most Rosharans, have epicanthic folds. They are typically short, although some can grow as tall as the Alethi. Their most recognizable, distinguishing feature are their long white eyebrows, which they sometimes tuck behind their ears. There seems to be no upper limit on how long they can grow, other than sheer practicality. The Thaylen men additionally have white beards, regardless of their age or the color of their hair. Thaylen architecture is flowery and decorative, unlike the more utilitarian Alethi structures. They also have a traditional weapon called the gtet, notable for its wedge-shaped blade and a grip that forces the user to hold it like a fist. Thaylen sailors use sabers instead.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_CIVILIZATIONS_PAGE_CIVILIZATION_BCA_THAYLENAH_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_7',	
	'Thaylenah is well known for its merchants. Thaylen traders can be found across the entire continent, as far West as Shinovar and as far North as the Reshi Isles. On land, they typically travel in caravans of wagons, while on sea, they have their own ships. The goods they carry range from Soulcast metals to slaves. Merchants in Thaylenah are ranked, from apprentice to master merchant. The position is equally open to both men and women, and even to non-Thaylens. Trade forms the backbone of Thaylen economy, leading to merchant councils holding significant power over the reigning monarch, including participating in the election alongside the navy officers. The position of a master merchant can serve as a path to a high rank in the Thaylen government.'),

	'Thaylenah''s brigantines make up a crucial part of its naval power and tradition. While their might has not yet been tested, the brigantines make Thaylenah the most dominant naval power on all of Roshar.'),
	('en_US',	'LOC_PEDIA_UNITS_PAGE_UNIT_BCA_BRIGANTINE_CHAPTER_HISTORY_PARA_2',  	
	'Being stationed on a brigantine is considered a mark of great status with Thaylen society, and brigantine captains often serve important positions on governing councils.'	),

	'Thaylenah''s wet docks represent major trade and naval powerhouses within its economy. Often, hundreds of ships can enter and leave a single wet dock each day, exchanging massive quantities of goods. The design of Thaylenah''s wet docks also allowed for the efficient mass construction of its fleets, including their fabled brigantines.');
